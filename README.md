# 📦 Gami's Stream Snag
## 🌟 Highlights

- A beautiful UI wrapper for the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) command line tool
- Written for Native MacOS

## ℹ️ Overview

Hey there! 👋

The idea for this project came about when Twitch announced a 100-hour storage limit on uploads and highlights, starting April 19, 2025. [Read the announcement here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand?language=en_US#storage).

Unfortunately, Twitch isn’t offering a way to bulk download videos before they start deleting them. The platform has stated that content will be removed based on view count, starting with the least-watched highlights until a channel is within the limit.

I created Gami's Stream Snag to provide a beautiful, user-friendly GUI for working with yt-dlp. Not everyone is comfortable with command-line tools, so I wanted to make the task of preserving video content as accessible as possible.
